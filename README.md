# Data-Analysis-of-Magneto-Hydrodynamic-Waves-and-Energy-Transport-in-the-Solar-Corona

In this project, I investigated the coronal heating problem by employing Magneto-Hydrodynamics (MHD) to explore energy transport and dissipation through waves in the solar atmosphere. Utilizing data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), I conducted an analysis of propagating waves in the solar corona. Using Interactive Data Language (IDL) and SolarSoft, I performed spatial and temporal image analysis on multi-wavelength observations, processing time-distance intensity maps to detect wave signatures and calculate propagation speeds across various temperature filters. Fourier analysis was employed to examine frequency distributions and power spectra at different coronal heights. The findings revealed evidence supporting the existence of slow magneto-acoustic waves and indicated potential wave damping, thereby enhancing our understanding of energy dynamics in the solar corona.
